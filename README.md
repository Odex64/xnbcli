# xnbcli
xnbcli is a tool to convert .xnb files back to their original format and vice-versa!

Unlike other tools out there, xnbcli can take advantage of special flags and compress files even further (as specified by the the [xnb format](https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio/wiki/Compiled-(XNB)-Content-Format)).
